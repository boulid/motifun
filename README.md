Get motivated and have fun while working on Trello.

Use npm install to install the dependency.
After creating a power up (https://trello.com/power-ups/admin), use Ngrok (ngrok http 3000) to creat a tunnel between your local netwrok and the internet on port 3000 and past the generated https url into the manifest url (for example "https://c0a625a2.ngrok.io/manifest.json").
Start the server using : node Server.js and then creat a board team in order to enable the power up and see it in action.
